# Arrays problem set

* Write a function printReverse() that takes an array as an argument and prints out the elements in the array in reverse order
> Don't actually reverse the array itself
***
* Write a function isUniform() which takes an array as an argument and returns true if all the elements in the array are identical.
> e.g `isUniform([23,23,23,23]) //true` `isUniform([23,23,10,23]) //false`
